                    <p>SpaceX has gained worldwide attention for a series of historic milestones. It is the only
                        private
                        company capable of returning a spacecraft from low-Earth orbit, and in 2012 our Dragon
                        spacecraft became the first commercial spacecraft to deliver cargo to and from the
                        International
                        Space Station. And in 2020, SpaceX became the first private company to take humans there as
                        well. Click through the timeline above to see some of our milestone accomplishments.</p>

                <h1>REUSABILITY</h1>
                <p>SpaceX believes a fully and rapidly reusable rocket is the pivotal breakthrough needed to
                    substantially reduce the cost of space access. The majority of the launch cost comes from
                    building
                    the rocket, which historically has flown only once.</p>
                <p>Compare that to a commercial airliner – each new plane costs about the same as Falcon 9 but can
                    fly
                    multiple times per day and conduct tens of thousands of flights over its lifetime. Following the
                    commercial model, a rapidly reusable space launch vehicle could reduce the cost of traveling to
                    space by a hundredfold.</p>
                <p>While most rockets are designed to burn up on reentry, SpaceX rockets can not only withstand
                    reentry
                    but can also successfully land back on Earth and refly again.</p>

                        capable of
                        reflight. Depending on the performance required for the mission, Falcon lands on one of our
                        autonomous spaceport droneships out on the ocean or one of our landing zones near our launch
